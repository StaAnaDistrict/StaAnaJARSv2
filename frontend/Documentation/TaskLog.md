You  only have 1 task and that is I want you to process all HTML files in my frontend, extracting and refactoring every CSS block into dedicated external files, it will be stored in frontend/css folder and you can see that there are already files available there which were already accomplished previously from the other files. 

Extact the CSS and use it as the source for the html file it was extracted from as a stylesheet reference in order to lessen the number of lines inside the html file. 

Here are the html files you need to work on:
